Herein I document the configurations I utilise with Emacs.
Of note are:

 ◈ This is a literate programming setup.

 ◈ I have a variety of cosmetics such as showing battery life and flashing upon errors.
   + Greating message “Welcome to Emacs 26.1 with Org-mode 9.2.2”.

 ◆ Discoverability capabilities.
    + Spacemacs look and feel with completion frameworks ~Helm~ and ~which-key~.

 ◈ Utilities for working with org-mode files, namely extracting ~#+KEYWORD: VALUE~ pairs.

As a [[https://www.offerzen.com/blog/literate-programming-empower-your-writing-with-emacs-org-mode][literate program]] file with [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]], I am ensured optimal navigation
through my ever growing configuration files, ease of usability and reference
for peers, and, most importantly, better maintainability for myself!

* Booting Up
** ~~/.emacs~ vs. ~init.org~

Why not keep Emac's configurations in the ~~/.emacs~ file?
This is because the Emacs system may explicitly add, or alter, code
in it.

For example, execute the following
 0. ~M-x customize-variable RET line-number-mode RET~
   # (customize-variable 'line-number-mode)
 0. Then press: ~toggle~, ~state~, then ~1~.
 0. Now take a look: ~(find-file "~/.emacs")~
Notice how additions to the file have been created by `custom'.

As such, I've chosen to write my Emacs' initialisation configurations
in a file named ~~/.emacs.d/init.org~: I have a literate configuration which
is then loaded using org-mode's tangling feature.
Read more about Emacs' initialisation configurations [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html#Init-File][here.]]

Off topic, I love tiling window managers and had been using [[https://xmonad.org][xmonad]]
until recently when I obtained a mac machine and now use 
[[https://ianyh.com/amethyst/][Amethyst]] -- “Tiling window manager for macOS along the lines of xmonad.”

** Elementary Version Control
:Properties:
:TODO: Make some of these eshell commands that are executed?
       Usage would be to simply C-x C-e the fragment to have
       all of these transpire for you ^_^
:End:

[[http://www.linfo.org/hard_link.html][Soft links]] are pointers to other filenames, whereas hardlinks
are pointers to memory location of a given filename!
Soft links are preferable since they defer to the orginal filename
and can work across servers.

We can declare them as follows,
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
ln -s source_file myfile
#+END_EXAMPLE

If ~repo~ refers to a directory under version control
--or Dropbox-- we move our init file and emacs directory to it,
then make soft links to these locations so that whenever ~~/.emacs~ 
is accessed it will refer to ~repo/.emacs~ and likewise for ~.emacs.d~ :-)

On a new machine, copy-paste any existing emacs configs we want
to the ~repo~ folder then ~rm -rf ~~/.emacs*~ and then make the soft
links only.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
repo=~/Dropbox     ## or my git repository: ~/dotfiles

cd ~

mv .emacs $repo/
ln -s $repo/.emacs .emacs

mv .emacs.elc $repo/
ln -s $repo/.emacs.elc .emacs.elc
          
mv .emacs.d/ $repo/
ln -s $repo/.emacs.d/ .emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE
Note the extra ~/~ after ~.emacs.d~!

You may need to unlink soft links if you already have them;
e.g., ~unlink .emacs.d~.

To make another softlink to a file, say in a blogging directory,
we ~cd~ to the location of interest then execute, say:
~ln -s $repo/.emacs.d/init.org init.org~

While we're at it, let's make this super-duper file (and another) easily
accessible --since we'll be altering it often--:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
cd ~

ln -s dotfiles/.emacs.d/init.org init.org
ln -s alhassy.github.io/content/AlBasmala.org AlBasmala.org
#+END_EXAMPLE

Below I'll equip us with an Emacs ‘porcelain’ interface to git
--it makes working with version control tremendously convenient.
Moreover, I add a little pop-up so that I don't forget to commit often!

** What's in, or at the top of, my ~~/.emacs~

We evaluate every piece of emacs-lisp code available here when
Emacs starts up by placing the following at the top of our ~.emacs~ file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; ⟪March 7, 2019⟫ For some reason, I need these here or my org-mode defaults to an older version.
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/"))
(package-initialize)
(require 'org-tempo)

(org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.org")
;;
;; My Emacs settings: (find-file "~/.emacs.d/init.org")
#+END_SRC
( I do not generate my ~.emacs~ file from this source code in-fear of
   overriding functionality inserted by ~custom~. )

# Whenever this ~init.org~ is loaded by org-babel it creates a ~.emacs~ file which
Our ~.emacs~ should be byte-compiled so that when we start Emacs it will
automatically determine if the ~init.org~ file has changed and if so it
would tangle it producing the ~init.el~ file which will then be loaded immediately.

:Maybe_bad_idea:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; In-case I forget to byte-compile!
(byte-compile-file "~/.emacs")

;; Change this silly counter to visualy notice a change. When making many changes.
;; (progn (message "Init.org contents loaded! Counter: 7") (sleep-for 3))
#+END_SRC
:End:

:Old_spacemacs_ideas:
Get onto rolling version of spacemacs:

git checkout develop
git pull --rebase

Recently I've switched to spacemacs, and to avoid too much migration
I've simply called this literate configuration from within ~~.spacemacs~
via the ~dotspacemacs/user-config~ method.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  "Configuration function for user code.
   This function is called at the very end of Spacemacs initialization after
   layers configuration.
   This is the place where most of your configurations should be done. Unless it is
   explicitly specified that a variable should be set before a package is loaded,
   you should place your code here."

   (org-babel-load-file "~/dotfiles/.emacs.d/init.org")
)
#+end_src

Moreover, in the ~dotspacemacs/layers~ method in ~.spacemacs~,
I have the following so that spacemacs does not delete
layer-orphan packages in an attempt to ‘clean up’ my unsued
packages.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(htmlize biblio magit haskell-mode dash s)
#+end_src
:End:

** ~use-package~ --The start ~init.el~

:Stuff_in_dot_emacs:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; In ~/.emacs
;;
;; (require 'package)
;; (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/"))
;; (package-initialize)
;; (require 'org-tempo)
;; 
#+end_src
:End:

Let's get ~use-package~ --a meta-package that manages other packages and the way they interact.

Background:
Recently I switched to mac --first time trying the OS.
I had to do a few ~package-install~'s and it was annoying.
I'm looking for the best way to package my Emacs installation 
--inlcuding my installed pacakages and configuration--
so that I can quickly install it anywhere, say if I go to another machine.
It seems ~use-package~ allows me to configure and auto install packages. 
On a new machine, when I clone my ~.emacs.d~ and start emacs,
on the first start it should automatically install and compile 
all of my packages through ~use-package~ when it detects they're missing.

# The following block should be the top-most loaded items.

First we need the basic ~package~ module which not only allows us to obtain ~use-package~ but
acts as its kernel.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Make all commands of the “package” module present.
(require 'package)

;; Speef up start up by not loading any packages at startup.
;; (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
;; Look at the *Messages* buffer before setting this to nil, then after.

;; Internet repositories for new packages.
(setq package-archives '(("org"       . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                         ("gnu"       . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa"     . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                         ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")))

;; Actually get “package” to work.
(package-initialize) 
#+END_SRC

We can now:
+ ~M-x list-packages~ to see all melpa packages that can install
  - Not in alphabetical order, so maybe search with ~C-s~.
+ For example to download the haskell mode: ~M-x package-install RET haskell-mode RET~.
  - Or maybe to install ~unicode-fonts~ ;-)
+ Read more at http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_package_system.html or 
  at https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa

:Faq:
If there are issues with loading the archives,
say, "Failed to download ‘gnu’ archive."
then ensure you can both read and write, recursively, to your .emacs.d/
E.g., within emacs try to execute (package-refresh-contents)
and you'll observe a permissions error.
:End:

We now bootstrap ~use-package~,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Unless it's already installed, update the packages archives,
;; then install the most recent version of “use-package”.
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))

(require 'use-package)
#+END_SRC

We can now invoke ~(use-package XYZ :ensure t)~
which should check for the ~XYZ~ package and make sure it is accessible. 
If not, the ~:ensure t~ part tells ~use-package~ to download it 
--using ~package.el~--
and place it somewhere accessible, in ~~/.emacs.d/elpa/~ by default.
The ~:ensure~ installs the files 

Here's an example use of ~use-package~.
Below I have my /show recent files pop-up/ set to ~C-x C-r~;
but what if I forget? This mode shows me all key completions when I type ~C-x~, for example.
Moreover, I will be shown other commands I did not know about! Neato :-)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Making it easier to discover Emacs key presses.
(use-package which-key 
 :ensure t
 :init (which-key-mode)
 :config (which-key-setup-side-window-bottom)
         (setq which-key-idle-delay 0.05)
)
#+END_SRC

Here are other packages that I want to be installed onto my machine.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (package-refresh-contents)     ;; Always stay up to date.

;; Nice looking theme ^_^
(when nil ;; this gives me an error for some reason
(use-package spacemacs-theme
  :ensure t
  :init (load-theme 'spacemacs-light t)
        ; (load-theme 'spacemacs-dark t)
))
#+END_SRC

The [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/tree/screenshots][Doom Themes]] also look rather appealing.
A showcase of many themes can be found [[https://emacsthemes.com/][here]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Efficient version control.
(use-package magit
  :ensure t
  :config (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'magit-status)
)

(use-package htmlize :ensure)     ;; Org produced htmls are coloured.
(use-package biblio  :ensure)     ;; Quick BibTeX references, sometimes.

;; Get org-headers to look pretty! E.g., * → ⊙, ** ↦ ◯, *** ↦ ★
;; https://github.com/emacsorphanage/org-bullets
(use-package org-bullets :ensure t)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-bullets-mode)

(use-package haskell-mode :ensure)

;; (use-package flycheck          ;; Dynamic syntax checking.
;;  :init (global-flycheck-mode) :ensure)

(use-package dash :ensure)    ;; “A modern list library for Emacs”
(use-package s    :ensure)    ;; “The long lost Emacs string manipulation library”.
#+END_SRC

Note:
+ [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]]: “A modern list library for Emacs”
  - E.g., ~(--filter (> it 10) (list 8 9 10 11 12))~
+ [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s]]: “The long lost Emacs string manipulation library”.
  - E.g., ~s-trim, s-replace, s-join~.

Finally, since I've symlinked my ~.emacs~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Don't ask for confirmation when opening symlinked file.

** ~magit~ --Emacs' porcelain interface to git

Why use ~magit~ as the interface to the git version control system?
In a magit buffer nearly everything can be acted upon:
Press ~return,~ or ~space~, to see details and ~tab~ to see children items, usually.

# Execute ~M-x dired~ to see the contents of a particular directory.
#
Below is my personal quick guide to working with magit.
A quick magit tutorial can be found on [[http://jr0cket.co.uk/2012/12/driving-git-with-emacs-pure-magic-with.html.html][jr0cket's blog]]

+ ~magit-init~ :: Put a project under version control. 
  The mini-buffer will prompt you for the top level folder version.
  A ~.git~ folder will be created there.

+ ~magit-status~ , ~C-x g~ :: See status in another buffer. Press ~?~ to see options,
     including:
  - ~q~ :: Quit magit, or go to previous magit screen.
  - ~s~ :: Stage, i.e., add, a file to version control.
         Add all untracked files by selecting the /Untracked files/ title.  
  - ~k~ :: Kill, i.e., delete a file locally.
  - ~K~ :: This' ~(magit-file-untrack)~ which does ~git rm --cached~.
  - ~i~ :: Add a file to the project ~.gitignore~ file. Nice stuff =)
  - ~u~ :: Unstage a specfif staged change highlighed by cursor.
           ~C-u s~ stages everything --tracked or not.
  - ~c~ :: Commit a change.
    * A new buffer for the commit message appears, you write it then
      commit with ~C-c C-c~ or otherwise cancel with ~C-c C-k~.
      These commands are mentioned to you in the minibuffer when you go to commit.
    * You can provide a commit to /each/ altered chunk of text! 
      This is super neat, you make a series of local such commits rather
      than one nebulous global commit for the file. The ~magit~ interface
      makes this far more accessible than a standard terminal approach!
    * You can look at the unstaged changes, select a /region/, using ~C-SPC~ as usual, 
      and commit only that if you want!
    * When looking over a commit, ~M-p/n~ to efficiently go to previous or next altered sections.
    * Amend a commit by pressing ~a~ on ~HEAD~.  

  - ~d~ :: Show differences, another ~d~ or another option.
    - This is magit! Each hunk can be acted upon; e.g., ~s~ or ~c~ or ~k~ ;-)
    - [[https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/119807/185815][The staging area is akin to a pet store; commiting is taking the pet home.]]  
  - ~v~ :: Revert a commit.         
  - ~x~ :: Undo last commit. Tantamount to ~git reset HEAD~~ when cursor is on most recent
           commit; otherwise resets to whatever commit is under the cursor.
  - ~l~ :: Show the log, another ~l~ for current branch; other options will be displayed.
    - Here ~space~ shows details in another buffer while cursour remains in current
      buffer and, moreover, continuing to press ~space~ scrolls through the other buffer!
      Neato.
  - ~P~ :: Push.
  - ~F~ :: Pull.
  - ~:~ :: Execute a raw git command; e.g., enter ~whatchanged~.

  The status buffer may be refereshed using ~g~, and all magit buffer by ~G~.
  # E.g., when you make git changes outside of emacs.
  Press ~tab~ to see collapsed items, such as what text has been changed.

Notice that every time you press one of these commands, a ‘pop-up’ of realted git options
appears! Thus not only is there no need to memorize many of them, but this approach makes
discovering other commands easier.

Use ~M-x (magit-list-repositories) RET~ to list local repositories:

Below are the git repos I'd like to clone
(setq magit-clone-set-remote.pushDefault t) ;; Do not ask about this variable when cloning.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Flyspell needs a spell checking tool, which is not included in Emacs. 
We install ~aspell~ spell checker using, say, homebrew via ~brew install aspell~.
Note that Emacs' ~ispell~ is the interface to such a command line spelling utility.

* Helpful Functions & Shortcuts

Here is a collection of Emacs-lisp functions that I have come to use in other files.
# The subsections below detail the definitions.

** Bind ~recompile~ to ~C-c C-m~ -- “m” for “m”ake
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar my-keys-minor-mode-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-m") 'recompile)
    map)
  "my-keys-minor-mode keymap.")

(define-minor-mode my-keys-minor-mode
  "A minor mode so that my key settings override annoying major modes."
  :init-value t
  :lighter " my-keys")

(my-keys-minor-mode)
#+END_SRC
** Reload buffer with ~f5~ 
I do this so often it's not even funny.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key [f5] '(lambda () (interactive) (revert-buffer nil t nil)))
#+END_SRC

In Mac OS, one uses ~Cmd-r~ to reload a page and spacemacs binds buffer reversion to ~Cmd-u~
--in Emacs, Mac's ~Cmd~ is referred to as the ‘super key’ and denoted ~s~.

** Kill to start of line
Dual to ~C-k~,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(global-set-key "\M-k" '(lambda () (interactive) (kill-line 0)) )

   (lisp-interaction-mode))   
#+END_SRC
** Switching from 2 horizontal windows to 2 vertical windows
I often find myself switching from a horizontal view of two windows in Emacs to a
vertical view. This requires a variation of ~C-x 1 RET C - x 3 RET C-x o X-x b RET~. 
Instead I now only need to type ~C-|~ to make this switch.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun ensure-two-vertical-windows () 
  "hello"
 (interactive)
 (other-window 1)			;; C-x 0

#+END_SRC
** Locally ~toggle~ a variable

It is dangerous to load a file with local variables;
instead we should load files without evaluating locals,
read the locals to ensure they are safe --e.g., there's nothing
malicious like ~eval: (delete-file your-important-file.txt)~--
then revert the buffer to load the locals.

However, when preprocessing my own files I sometimes wish
to accept all locals without being queried and so have the following
combinator.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defmacro toggle (variable value code)
  "Locally set the value of ‘variable’ to be ‘value’ in the scope of ‘code’.
   In particular, the value of ‘variable’, if any, *is* affected
   to produce useful sideffects. It retains its orginal value outside this call.

   Example uses include terse replacements for one-off let-statements,
   or, more likely, of temporarily toggeling important values, such as 
   ‘kill-buffer-query-functions’ for killing a process buffer without confirmation.

   Another example: ‘(toggle enable-local-variables :all ⋯)’ to preprocess files
   without being queried about possibly dangerous local variables.
  "
  `(let ((_initial_value_ ,variable))
        (setq ,variable ,value)
        ,code
        (setq ,variable _initial_value_)
  )
)
#+end_src

#+begin_example emacs-lisp

** Obtaining Values of ~#+KEYWORD~ Annotations

Org-mode settings are, for the most part, in the form ~#+KEYWORD: VALUE~. Of notable interest
are the ~TITLE~ and ~NAME~ keywords. We use the following ~org-keywords~ function to obtain
the values of arbitrary ~#+THIS : THAT~ pairs, which may not necessarily be supported by native
Org-mode --we do so for the case, for example, of the ~CATEGORIES~ and ~IMAGE~ tags associated with an article.

# Parse org buffer as an elisp structure: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/2869/turn-a-list-or-data-structure-into-an-org-document#

(defun org-keyword (KEYWORD)
  "Get the value of a KEYWORD in the form of #+KEYWORD: value"

#+END_SRC

Note that capitalisation in a ”#+KeyWord” is irrelevant.

** Org Speed Keys
Let's enable the [[http://notesyoujustmightwanttosave.blogspot.com/2011/12/org-speed-keys.html][Org Speed Keys]] so that when the cursor is at the beginning of 
a headline, we can perform fast manipulation & navigation using the standard Emacs movement
controls, such as 
+ ~I/O~ clock In/Out to the task defined by the current heading. 
   - Keep track of your work times!
   - ~v~ view agenda.
+ ~u~ for jumping upwards to the parent heading.
+ ~c~ for cycling structure below current heading, or ~C~ for cycling global structure.
+ ~i~ insert a new same-level heading below current heading.
+ ~w~ refile current heading; options list pops-up to select which heading to move it to. Neato!
+ ~t~ cycle through the available TODO states.
+ ~^~ sort children of current subtree; brings up a list of sorting options.
+ ~n/p~ for next/previous /visible/ heading.
+ ~f/b~ for jumping forward/backward to the next/previous /same-level/ heading.
+ ~D/U~ move a heading down/up.

** Template expansion (<s Tab, etc.)
In org-mode we type ~<X TAB~ to obtain environment templates, such as ~<s~ for source blocks
or ~<q~ for quote blocks. 
It seems recent [[https://orgmode.org/Changes.html#org1b5e967][changes]] to the org-mode structure template expansion
necessitate explicitly loading ~org-tempo~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-tempo)
#+end_src

To insert source blocks with the assistance of a pop-up: ~C-c C-v d~ ;-)
Perhaps more usefully, invokcaing within a source block splits it up into two
seperate blocks! Moreover, if invoked on a selected region, it puts the region
into a new code block! Wow!

+ ~<X~ allows you to obtain the org-block assigned to shortcut ~x~.
+ ~C-C C-v C-d~ and ~C-c C-v d~ refer to the ~org-babel-demarcate-block~, which
  provides /source/ blocks.
+ ~C-c C-,~ refers to ~org-insert-structure-template~, which
  provides non-source blocks, such as quote ~<q~ and comment ~C~.
