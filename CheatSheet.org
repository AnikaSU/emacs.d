#+DESCRIPTION: This document is written by Musa Al-hassy for his learning in the Winter of 2019.

* Why?

There are already cheatsheets for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf][Emacs]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/orgcard.pdf][Org]], and even [[https://github.com/alhassy/ElispCheatSheet/blob/master/CheatSheet.pdf][Elisp]];
so why bother with another one? The general ones are great but contain
stuff I rarely use, such as information on registers, but are missing
stuff I'd like to know, such as Helm keybindings which are not shipped with Emacs.

Below are the bindings that are shipped with Emacs or the packages one installs.
To be somewhat useful to others, my personal bindings will be “enclosed” in quotes.
I will write ~X,Y-x,y~ to denote one of ~X~ or ~Y~ followed by one of ~x~ or ~y~; e.g.,
~C,M-d~ denotes ~C-d~ and ~M-d~ --for character and word deletion, respectively.
Hopefully this makes it easier to group related commands.

* TODO Provide support for /three/ columns, not two.
* TODO Shortcuts of each package; e.g., swoop, helm, etc.

* Textual Navigation
  | ~C-b, f~ | ←, → character       |
  | ~M-b, f~ | ←, → word            |
  |--------+----------------------|
  | ~C-p, n~ | ↑,↓ line             |
  | ~M-g g~  | go to a line         |
  |--------+----------------------|
  | ~C-a, e~ | start, end line      |
  | ~M-a, e~ | start, end sentence  |
  | ~M-{, }~ | start, end paragraph |
  | ~M-<, >~ | start, end buffer    |
  |--------+----------------------|
  | ~C-v~    | down page            |
  | ~M-v~    | up page              |
  | ~C-l~    | centre page          |

  _Org-mode_: All commands are prefixed by ~C-c~.

  | ~n,p~ | next, previous heading     |
  | ~f,b~ | n,p same level heading     |
  | ~C-u~ | backward to higher heading |
  | ~C-j~ | ↑↓ jump to another heading |
  
* Marking & Regions
  | ~C-SPC~   | Set mark              |
  | ~C-x C-x~ | Exchange point & mark |
  | ~M-h~     | Mark paragraph        |
  | ~C-x h~   | Mark buffer           |

* Killing & Yanking

  | ~C,M-d~       | forward kill character, word |
  | ~C,M-del~     | backward kill word prefix    |
  | ~C-k~ , “M-k” | forward, backward kill line  |
  | ~C-x del~     | backward kill sentence       |
  |-------------+------------------------------|
  | ~C,M-w~       | Kill, copy region            |
  | ~C-x r k~     | Kill region                  |

  By default ~M-k~ is forward kill sentence.

* Narrowing 

This allows us to “zoom in” or “focus” on a particular region;
the rest of the buffer is ‘hidden’. All commands begin with ~C-x n~.
   
| ~n~ | Narrow to region                   |
| ~w~ | Widen to full view                 |
| ~e~ | Narrow to org element              |
| ~s~ | Narrow anywhere inside org subtree |

* Org Visibility

| ~tab~         | Cycle visibility                |
| ~S-tab~       | Cycle /global/ visibility         |
| ~C-c C-x C-v~ | Toggle inline image display     |
| ~C-c C-x C-l~ | Toggle, preview, LaTeX for tree |

* Structure Editing 

 | ~C-[S]-Ret~   | new [Todo] heading after current tree                    |

 | ~C-c -,*~     | Demote, promote headings to items                        |
 |-------------+----------------------------------------------------------|

 | ~C-c , A,B,C~ | Set priority ~A, B,~ or ~C~ for tree                         |
 | ~C-c , Spc~   | Remove priority from tree                                |
 |-------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
 | ~M-↑,↓~       | Move /any/ org element up or down                          |
 | ~M-S-↑,↓~     | Move a line up or down                                   |
