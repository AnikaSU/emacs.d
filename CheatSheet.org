* Why?

I have so many things installed, I'm forgetting some of the stuff
that I installed to be more productive! Whence this personal cheat sheet.

:More:
There are already cheatsheets for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf][Emacs]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/orgcard.pdf][Org]], and even [[https://github.com/alhassy/ElispCheatSheet/blob/master/CheatSheet.pdf][Elisp]];
so why bother with another one? The general ones are great but contain
stuff I rarely use, such as information on registers, but are missing
stuff I'd like to know, such as Helm keybindings which are not shipped with Emacs.

Below are the bindings that are shipped with Emacs or the packages one installs.
To be somewhat useful to others, my personal bindings will be ‚Äúenclosed‚Äù in quotes.
I will write ~X,Y-x,y~ to denote one of ~X~ or ~Y~ followed by one of ~x~ or ~y~; e.g.,
~C,M-d~ denotes ~C-d~ and ~M-d~ --for character and word deletion, respectively.
Hopefully this makes it easier to group related commands.

As always, since I've installed ~which-key~, it suffices to press a prefix
then look at the resulting menu üòÉ

~C-x 4 ?~ is for acting on the other window, where
~? = f, d, b~

  All commands are prefixed by ~C-x x~; main commands:

  {{{no-vertical-padding(1.5)}}}
  
+ ~C-x u~ Visualise undo tree.
  - ~t, d~ toggle timestamps and diff display.
  - ~M-{,}~ Go to previous, next branching point.
  - ~q~ Exit at currently selected state.            
+ ~C-x r u~ Save current buffer state.
+ ~C-x r U~ Restore saved buffer state.    

Save & restore is useful for experimenting with
a function definition, for example.

:Rmrk:
Undo Tree also has functions which save an undo state to a register and which restore a save state from a register. These are bound to C-x r u and C-x r U by default. These are great for things like experimenting with a function definition.
